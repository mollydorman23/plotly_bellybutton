# plotly_bellybutton

## Project Overview:

For this challenge, I created a dashboard with visuals based on data for the types of bacteria found on a set of human volunteers. The idea is that certain types of bacteria may be able to be used in creating a new type of beef substitute for the company Improbable Beef. The dashboard allows users to identify the top 10 bacterial species in the belly buttons of our volunteers. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
